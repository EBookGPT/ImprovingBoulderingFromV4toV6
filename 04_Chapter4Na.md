# Chapter 4: Navigating Route Setting and Grading Systems

*As I sit down to write this chapter, I can't help but remember my first bouldering competition. I walked into the gym, excited to take on the new challenges that awaited me. But as I looked around at the plethora of brightly colored holds and the climbers scaling the walls with ease, I felt intimidated and overwhelmed. How was I supposed to know which problems to try? What did all these different colors mean? And what on earth did V4, V5, and V6 even signify? Later on, I realized that these questions are some of the most common ones that new boulderers face. But with the right knowledge, navigating route setting and grading systems can be a breeze.*

# Chapter 4: Navigating Route Setting and Grading Systems

The church bell struck midnight as Dracula flew over the rocky outcropping that marked his secret bouldering haven. For years, he had trained under the cover of darkness, pushing his limits on the V4 and V5 problems that littered the area. But tonight, things were different. Tonight, Dracula was determined to push himself to the next level and complete the elusive V6 boulder that had been taunting him for months. He landed on the ground, leaped out of his cape, and approached the freshly set problem. But as he looked up, he realized that he was facing a new challenge: the holds were marked with colors he had never seen before. 

Dracula started to panic. He knew that the colors were more than just decoration. They were a system that allowed climbers to know which holds to use, based on the route setters' intentions. But Dracula had never been good at understanding systems, and the colors made no sense to him. Time was running out, and he had to make a decision. He closed his eyes and pictured his favorite climbing spot, envisioning himself effortlessly scaling the toughest V5 problems as if they were nothing. And then an idea occurred to him. He reached for his phone and called his good friend, Chris Sharma. 

"Hey, Chris," Dracula said. "It's Dracula."

"Hey, man. What's up?" Chris replied.

"I'm stuck on a V6, and the holds have these colors that I don't understand. Can you help me?"

Chris laughed. "Sure thing. Let's take a look."

They opened a climbing app together and browsed through the V6 problems, discussing the holds' colors and how to approach them. Chris explained the grading system and how it works, from V0 to V16, and how each grade represents a different level of difficulty. He also shared his tips on how to understand the route setters' intentions and how to use the colors to your advantage.

Dracula listened intently, asking questions and taking notes. With Chris's guidance, he understood the system and knew which holds to use on the problem he wanted to climb. With newfound confidence, Dracula attacked the V6 with ferocity, his fangs bared in determination. He climbed with ease, making his way to the top and claiming his prize.

As he clung to the last hold, Dracula felt proud and accomplished. He had conquered the V6, but more importantly, he had learned a valuable lesson: navigating route setting and grading systems was not impossible, but with the right knowledge and guidance, it was something that anyone could do.
